# +      after the initial request handshake. This applies to all subscribers except Websocket
# from the Nchan changelog, 7077fc8c, 1.2.7 (Mar. 17 2020)

# This is for *subscribing* to events. *Publishing* events, however, is instead
# confiured in nginx.conf, and done on port 81 (not 80 or 443).

# SECURITY SHOULD FAIR Use Nchan channel groups, to track aggregate channel usage, and set limits
# on the number of channels, subscribers, stored messages, memory use, etc, per site.

  # Here I posted about the segfault: https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/issues/1361
  # But is this really because of Talkyard's lua log phase? The not-modified header is instead
  # set by Ncahn, does maybe Nchan use Lua too?
  # COULD FAIR QUOTA reenable the log phase, so if really long comments get sent via notfs,
  # that affects the bandwidth used for the connected clients.
  # Don't disable the access-phase.lua though — we do want to reject clients that have used up
  # all their bandwidth quota.
